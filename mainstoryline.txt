cs: better call the HoH SiS
cs: they are really good at giving me the JoJ!
cs: (dials phone)
cs: hello, can you give me the JoJ?
HoH SiS operator: Is this a prank caller on the line?
cs: No! my house really needs foundation repair and I need help!
HoH SiS operator: Alright, that will be 200 cstars. You can pay us afterwards.
HoH SiS operator: (hangs up)

Wesley: He shoved an 18 inch dealdo up my backside!
Ed: He has made fun of our company, with his fans prank-calling us for the JoJ.
Richard: Cs no longer will get the JoJ.
Ed: So, what should we do to him?
Ed, Wesley, and Richard: Hmmm.....
<they look around>
Wesley: let's go check out his room.
Richard:*lick, lick* can I bring my ice-cream?
