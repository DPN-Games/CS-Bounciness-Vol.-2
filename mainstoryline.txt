(cs sitting in chair slowly rolls across the room)
cs: woah! this house has felt like it was sitting on a giant rock on the side of the house.
cs: I really need to get some foundation repair on this house.
cs: better call the HoH SiS
cs: they are really good at giving me the JoJ!
cs: (dials phone)
cs: hello, can you give me the JoJ?
HoH SiS operator: Is this a prank caller on the line?
cs: No! my house really needs foundation repair and I need help!
HoH SiS operator: Alright, that will be 200 cstars. You can pay us afterwards.
HoH SiS operator: (hangs up)
cs: Well that is one thing taken care of.
cs: I guess I will work on my new YTP while I wait.
(time passes)
<DoorBell Rings>
cs: Oh! they are here!

<door opens>
cs: Hello! I am Cs188, and I really need foundation repair.
HoH SiS worker: and you would like to suck a lot of cock, right?

HoH SiS worker: Alright, that will be 200 cstars.
cs: Alright, lemme get my wallet.

HoH SiS worker: You want the JoJ!

HoH SiS worker: Come on in guys. Cs left.
Richard: JoJ!
Ed: JoJ!
Wesley: Do we have have to do this all over again?
HoH SiS worker: So now we are at his house, why were you guys mad at him again?
Wesley: He shoved an 18 inch dealdo up my backside!
Ed: He has made fun of our company, with his fans prank-calling us for the JoJ.
Richard: Cs no longer will get the JoJ.
Ed: So, what should we do to him?
Ed, Wesley, and Richard: Hmmm.....
<they look around>
Wesley: let's go check out his room.
Richard:*lick, lick* can I bring my ice-cream?
Ed: Sure, just don't ruin his house completely. We don't want him to find out we were here and messed up his house.
<marches upstairs to his room (dim screen, make characters reappear in Cs Bedroom)>
Welsey: wow, I didn't know Cs plays nekopara.
Ed: CS suuurrre loves his cute catgirls~ <3
Welsey: Alright, but now what should we do?
Richard: what about his laptop?
Ed: Ehh....
Welsey: Wow, he even has a JoJ UFO of his stupid HoH SiS series, the one that humiliated us.
(Welsey grabs the trinket, Grasping in anger.)
(Still staring at it with frustration, he replaces it.)
Ed: Alright, how about we sabotage his computer?
<launches up craptop>
Ed: hehe... he won't know what hit him.
