Hello, thank you for testing CSBounciness Vol. 2

Please create a folder named as the date of the test in the format MM-DD-YYYY
followed by your username and "Test" (Ex. 12-20-2017 Arceus Test)

This way we can document errors and keep track of it chronologically, most likely will be
deleted before the game is released.

Other than that, enjoy your test.
