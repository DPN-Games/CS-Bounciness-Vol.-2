---Opening Remarks---
First of all before I begin this test, I gotta say. I WILL make careless mistakes and comments, It's 5:30 AM
Kill me

Anyways.

... And I gotta install Ren'Py on my desktop XD Oh mAaaaan

Alrighty, first up, we need a background graphic for the title screen, but aethstetics ( How the fuck do you spell this? ) Come last, of course: *reviews updates*


--- Finding Jail Route---
If I can remember how I get to it xD
I kicked Wesley off the building, I assume we're implementing that mp4 I made eventually? XD

o-o" Uh..

Screenshotting that.. Take a look at it when y'all get the chance

(Couldn't find it) Basically, inside house is now a character XD in the play through, so. Take what you will

"Whatever just take the computer" Doesn't have a name defined, if anything, put "Sales Person" or something

"Now I need to definetly delete my account" Then the game crashes.. 

---Finding Jail Route 2---
So that wasn't the jail route XD

Okay, I think chopping was it..
Maybe put in the slap chop? x3

Mmm
My character isn't on screen in the cell for the Jail (Arceus3251)
I believe there's an extra space between the ? in "cop" and the "I" in "I'm"

"Wanna break out? 3"

I may have mispelt "pleanty" in the script.. Hold on.. Lemme consult a dictionary.. *off mic* HEY CORTANA..
Nope

"Annorexorcist-something" I think it should be "Anno-something"

"Blush Thank you".. Cs Said Blush Thank you XD

Im pretty sure the background was supposed to change a while ago, Im at the border and Im still looking at a jail cell..

Im just assuming that only the story has been written out to the most part. No assets have been implemented, so. Yeah.

FatherDigBick isn't in Red, or at the top of the box for the first thing he says.

---Other Playthroughs---
Microcenter hasn't been implemented

Background still hasn't changed when I went to stream, still on the broken Microcenter..

Chat should be also Red and at the top of the text box (3x)

"Has this ever happened to anyone on stream before?" And the game crashes.

---Closing Remarks---
That's all the testing I've got time for, just a few errors I saw, pretty minor. Anyways, have fun with that.
